#Abstract

This project intends to assess the importance of urban tree distribution in addressing effects of a great phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). UHI is a kind of heat accumulation phenomenon within urban areas due to urban construction and human activities. These affect most cities including the City of Philadelphia, PA. Therefore, distribution of UHI and how trees contribute to its cooling effect is vital to the well-being of the city residents. This analysis can be done using linear regression machine learning techniques to understand the correlation between the spatial distributions of trees in the neighborhood and heating vulnerability.
