Abstract: This project was aimed at assessing the importance of urban tree distribution in addressing effects of a great phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). UHI is a kind of heat accumulation phenomenon within urban areas due to urban construction and human activities. These affect most cities including the City of Philadelphia, PA. Therefore, distribution of UHI and how trees contribute to its cooling effect is vital to the well-being of the city residents since this have influence on chronic diseases of residents. This analysis used linear regression, Correlation and Random Forest machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between the spatial distributions of trees in the neighborhood and heating vulnerability. HVI Score and Number pf trees was also be used to predict health factors in Philadelphia such as diabetes and blood pressure.

**Data:** Was collected at the census tract level

**1. Heat Vulnerability by Census Tract**  for 2017-2019 were obtained from **Open Data Philly** through the URL https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?q=Heat+Vulnerability+by+Census+Tract

**2. Philadelphia Tree Inventory** for 2021 were obtained from **Open Data Philly** through the URL https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-tree-inventory 

**3. Health factor variables** were obtained from the CDC 500 Cities dataset: https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2019-relea/6vp6-wxuq

> Arthritis: Percentage of population with arthritis

> Binge_Drinking: Percentage of population who binge drinks

> Blood_Pressure: Percentage of population with high blood pressure

> Cancer: Percentage of the population with cancer

> Heart_Disease: Percentage of the population with coronary heart disease

> Pulmonary_Disease: Percentage of the population with chronic pulmonary diease

> Diabetes: Percentage of the population with diabetes

> Sleep: Percentage of the population getting less than 7 hours of sleep

> Stroke: Percentage of the population experiencing strokes

> Obesity: Percentage of the population with obesity

> Smoking: Percentage of the population who smokes cigarettes 

**NOTE: Not all these attributes were used, But only the choosen chronic disease attributes**
