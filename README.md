#Abstract
Abstract: This project was aimed at assessing the importance of urban tree distribution in addressing effects of a great phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). UHI is a kind of heat accumulation phenomenon within urban areas due to urban construction and human activities. These affect most cities including the City of Philadelphia, PA. Therefore, distribution of UHI and how trees contribute to its cooling effect is vital to the well-being of the city residents since this have influence on chronic diseases of residents. This analysis used linear regression, Correlation and Random Forest machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between the spatial distributions of trees in the neighborhood and heating vulnerability. HVI Score and Number pf trees was also be used to predict health factors in Philadelphia such as diabetes and blood pressure.
